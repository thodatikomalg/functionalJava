So, far we, have been, sending, the request body in the raw format for our Requests.
Itâ€™s error-prone, and non-maintainable. We need to send the request body as an object.
We, will, use, the concept, of serialization and de-serialization to convert our request bodies into an object.
The, Rest, Assured, library depends on the Jackson (Databind) library, to do this work of Serialization.
